            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>I am try to be a web developer. I'm creating my projects using HTML5 , CSS3 , JavaScript ,jQuery.
            I studied at the system administrator in NU "LP", but after graduation, and even when I started working in the company which was engaged in selling high quality construction tools. 
            Up to a certain point I liked the work, but reaching the top bracket, I realized that it's time to change something. It has long wanted to try yourself in the IT industry, 
            and my beloved advised to try to get on courses at SoftServe.
            First attempts were made on lines "Manual QA" and "Automation QA", but I could not. Later, I found the course "HTML / CSS / JavaScr - Fundamentals" and decided to try it.
            Price for this course is worth that would determine for themselves whether the IT industry is that for me. I love this industry, the specifics of the work,
            and I hope that I will become a professional in their field and will demand specialist.
            I wanna grow up in programming part of IT industry.</p>
